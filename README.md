Notice:<br>
- Due to a codesigning error right now, you must sign the ipa yourself using a signing service for roms to appear unfortunately. If you install the ipa using Filza or AppInst, imported roms won't appear.

<br><br>

How to import roms:<br>
- You need to download roms to your idevice using Safari or Filza and press open in MeSNEmu and that will import them into the app
